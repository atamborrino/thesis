\chapter{Architecture and implementation of the Data Integration part}

As stated in the Requirements chapter, the Data Integration part must incrementally pull various REST APIs (data sources) in parallel. For each resource type in
in each data source, it must create an event flow. This event flow run through several data cleaning and data transformation steps that can
be asynchronous. Despite the asynchronous nature, it should ensure that the event flow remains in-order. In the end, event flows are pushed
into the Journal.
